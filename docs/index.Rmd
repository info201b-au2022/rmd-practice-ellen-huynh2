## Covid Report
The total number of COVID cases is 97,287,332. The total number of deaths is 1,066,576. These values make sense as there are more cases than deaths but either way, this is a significant number of deaths which highlights how much of an impact the pandemic made. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)
There are no commas for the death value because they did not use the pretty number function that adds in such commas as shown in the total cases. 

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
